<p>As we all know that coronavirus has been threatening us since 2020, it started in China, and now it’s affecting the rest of the world. Nowadays, people see the outbreak in a different light. I think that not only physical but also psychological problems need to be concerned. This article is talking about attitudes and psychological responses of different kinds of people.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Government</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Actually it’s hard to say something about Politics, as I am a Chinese so that I know more about my country. The outbreak originated in Wuhan, obviously the situation in Wuhan is the most serious. Wuhan had been cut off from all external traffic since January 23, and 11 million residents had been forced into quarantine. Other Chinese provinces and cities have since imposed blockades to control the spread of coronavirus. Doctors and nurses from other provinces were also volunteering to fight the epidemic. These actions effectively reduce irrational and unnecessary fears of people because the government has established an image of being responsible for the people. Now, in March, coronavirus has been controlled and most schools and universities post their opening dates.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Medical staff</strong></p>
<p>Since we know that  many doctors and nurses volunteered to help improve situation in Wuhan. However, sometimes we may see that news which was talking about mental breakdown of nurses and doctors. When other people were coming together and enjoyed a big dinner, they were still sticking to their posts and could only silently eat box lunch and takeout. Under this condition, strong comparisons and loneliness can make them feel overwhelmed and unable to stick it out. The more desperate thing was women nurses had to cut off their long hair as not to interfere with their hard work. This significantly increases the risk of depression among medical staff.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Depression is a common mental disorder affecting more than 264 million people worldwide. It is characterized by persistent sadness and a lack of interest or pleasure in previously rewarding or enjoyable activities. It can also disturb sleep and appetite; tiredness and poor concentration are common. The causes of depression include <strong>complex interactions between social, psychological and biological</strong> factors. (<strong>FROM <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/depression#tab=tab_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.who.int/health-topics/depression#tab=tab_1</a></strong>)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Students</strong></p>
<p>I wrote this blog on March 22nd and recently the most common news is international students want to come back to China as soon as possible even though the tickets are expensive and vetted very carefully. From the Internet, I learned about the response of different countries to the coronavirus, and I can fully understand the anxiety of international students and their parents. There are also many examples around me that Parents in China spend a lot of money on a plane ticket for their children to fly back. Some international students even feel like crying when they returned to China and met their parents. Their anxiety and uneasiness of being alone in a foreign land is beyond our imagination. Psychologists predict that there will be a large number of people with PTSD in 2020. For young students aged between 18 and 25, this is probably the first big event in their life, and also the biggest one, the impact is significant. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>PTSD: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a <strong>mental health condition</strong> that’s triggered by a terrifying event — either experiencing it or witnessing it. Symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares and severe anxiety, as well as uncontrollable thoughts about the event. (<strong>FROM<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20355967" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20355967</a></strong>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, I hope that the coronavirus will be controlled effectively in every corner of the world and the world will be restored to its original state!! Both physical and psychological harm can be cured someday!!!❤</p>

    <title>Numpy</title>
    <url>/2020/03/15/Numpy/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="Numpy-Study"><a href="#Numpy-Study" class="headerlink" title="Numpy Study"></a>Numpy Study</h1><p>After learning python, I started to learn numpy, a programming language for processing data. In the beginning, I thought that it seemed like all the programming languages look quite similar so that numpy wouldn’t be so difficult. However, <strong>that is impossible</strong>.😭</p>
<p>While I think I still found some interesting programming codes which are exactly what I imagined how a data-processing system looks like. In my opinion, data can be shown clearly by using line charts, bar charts, tables and normal distribution. Graphs can point out salient features and trends of data. Calculations can have the same functions, I learnt how to find mean, mode and median which are important information for  central tendency of a set of data; variance and standard deviation which are used to indicate spread of a set of data in the school, so I can also calculate these values by writing programming codes. Here is some examples:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">x=np.linspace(<span class="number">0</span>,<span class="number">5</span>,<span class="number">50</span>)</span><br><span class="line">y=np.linspace(<span class="number">0</span>,<span class="number">5</span>,<span class="number">50</span>)[:,np.newaxis]</span><br><span class="line">z=np.sin(x)**<span class="number">10</span>+np.cos(<span class="number">10</span>+y*x)*np.cos(x)</span><br><span class="line">%matplotlib inline</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> matplotlib.pyplot <span class="keyword">as</span> plt</span><br><span class="line">plt.imshow(z,origin=<span class="string">"lower"</span>,extent=[<span class="number">0</span>,<span class="number">5</span>,<span class="number">0</span>,<span class="number">5</span>],cmap=<span class="string">"viridis"</span>)</span><br><span class="line">plt.colorbar();</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>These codes can visualize the quadratic function, the graph looks like below:</p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/03/16/8tirUf.png" alt="8tirUf.png"></p>
<p>To be honest, it’s hard for me to imagine that I can plot those points on the graph and form the graph above, it’s quite amazing.</p>
<p>In addition to the function graph, I can also record data in terms of A scatter diagram and tables.</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> numpy <span class="keyword">as</span> np</span><br><span class="line">rand=np.random.RandomState(<span class="number">42</span>)</span><br><span class="line">mean=[<span class="number">0</span>,<span class="number">0</span>]</span><br><span class="line">cov=[[<span class="number">1</span>,<span class="number">2</span>],[<span class="number">2</span>,<span class="number">5</span>]]</span><br><span class="line">x=rand.multivariate_normal(mean,cov,<span class="number">100</span>)</span><br><span class="line">%matplotlib inline</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> matplotlib.pyplot <span class="keyword">as</span> plt</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> seaborn;seaborn.set()</span><br><span class="line">plt.scatter(x[:,<span class="number">0</span>],x[:,<span class="number">1</span>]);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/03/16/8tFvlQ.png" alt="8tFvlQ.png"></p>
<p>This graph visualises an array of points with a two-dimensional normal distribution.</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">data=[&#123;<span class="string">"a"</span>:i,<span class="string">"b"</span>:<span class="number">2</span> * i&#125;<span class="keyword">for</span> i <span class="keyword">in</span> range(<span class="number">3</span>)]</span><br><span class="line">pd.DataFrame(data)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>This programming code creates a two-dimensional array and records three sets of values in a table.</p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/03/16/8tmFt1.png" alt="8tmFt1.png"></p>
<p>It’s easier for us to use graphs to record these data as there are too much data needed to be processed, compared with thousands of words, graphs are more convenient and clearer. I think this is why humans need to use computers to help them work and this is why I need to learn them, some programmes can help me study with higher efficiency and more saved time. This is also reasons for not only science subjects but also liberal arts require students to know about programming codes and high-level statistical ability.</p>
<p>To be honest, I didn’t do well in numpy, it’s still hard for me to write a program without any help from coursebooks, maybe I need more chances to exercise and use it as a tool in my studying. I hope I can use it freely if I can have a chance to do my own experiment someday!😊</p>

    <title>Exams are coming..</title>
    <url>/2020/03/07/Exams-are-coming/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="Exams-are-coming"><a href="#Exams-are-coming" class="headerlink" title="Exams are coming.."></a>Exams are coming..</h1><p>Time goes really fast. There is only <strong>58</strong> days left till I will go to take exams. As we all know, AS exams are the most important exams in three years. However, when I realised that there is not much time left, there is only few days for me to review. This blog is used to record my revision plan.</p>
<hr>
<p>For <strong>Maths</strong> and <strong>Psychology</strong>, which I will take A-level exams, I will pay most of my attention on these two subjects because I want to use them to apply for universities. Although I am still learning A-level psychology, I don’t know whether I can have enough time to review, I will try to. For Maths, I don’t know other easier ways to review science subjects, maybe doing exercises is the most efficient way. I will do as many exercises as I can.</p>
<p>For three subjects left, I will try to achieve as high marks as possible, although I don’t like some subjects among them.. I don’t know whether I will continue learning them in A2, but I will try my best. I decided to do two paper for each subject from next week. Chemistry, Physics and Computer science, they are all science, I have said that the only way is doing exercises(why I only learn one liberal art /(ㄒoㄒ)/~~) </p>
<hr>
<p>Sometimes I cannot bear such studying mode and want to play games, watch animation. I didn’t do well in IG exams, without any course, I didn’t focus on studying that time. I don’t want to regret again. This time, I want to work hard and achieve my goal! Actually, I have decided what to do in summer holiday, I hope I can have a whole happy summer holiday (including score posted day). </p>

    <title>MY MAGIC PYTHON STUDYING</title>
    <url>/2020/01/30/MY%20MAGIC%20PYTHON%20STUDYING/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="HELLO-PYTHON"><a href="#HELLO-PYTHON" class="headerlink" title="HELLO! PYTHON!!!"></a>HELLO! PYTHON!!!</h1><p><img src="https://s2.ax1x.com/2020/01/30/1lr3eU.jpg" alt="1lr3eU.jpg"></p>
<p>This is my first time learning python, I heard about this programming code for a long time because as a student who chose Computer Science, I learned vb.net which is less used by people nowadays in the school. Other boys often talk about python, they said python is easier and useful. This winter holiday, finally! It’s my time to learn python!</p>
<hr>
<p>Maybe because I learned vb.net before, I found that programming code of python is similar to that of vb.net, including value assignment and other functions, so it’s easier for me to start. Of course, differences exist, I realised that python is much closer to human language than other programming codes. It is more convenient because we don’t need to declare each variables before using them into our code. Python is a language which is very sensible to indenting and strict to code formatting, I always fail to indent correctly and my code cannot be run successfully. <strong>FOR EXAMPLE</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://s2.ax1x.com/2020/01/30/1l2Ml9.png" alt="1l2Ml9.png"></p>
<p>Since I learned python, I cannot count how many times I saw this error message after clicking RUN button🙂 Sometimes I felt corrupted and entered a dead cycle. (<del>It’s a real hair loss</del>) Another common mistake is <strong>“:”</strong> Here is an example:</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.ax1x.com/2020/01/30/1lRS76.png" alt="1lRS76.png"></p>
<p>This is my python homework after first class, I felt quite familiar with this shape because I did solve this question in the school. However, it took me much time writing python programming code <strong>because of “:”</strong> My code is shown below:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">n=int(input(<span class="string">"enter a positive number"</span>))</span><br><span class="line">i=<span class="number">0</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> n&gt;=<span class="number">3</span>:</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">for</span> i <span class="keyword">in</span> range(n):</span><br><span class="line">        print(<span class="string">"*"</span> * i)</span><br><span class="line">        i=i+<span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">for</span> i <span class="keyword">in</span> range(n,<span class="number">0</span>,<span class="number">-1</span>):  </span><br><span class="line">        print(<span class="string">"*"</span> * i)</span><br><span class="line">        i=i+<span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">else</span>:</span><br><span class="line">    print(<span class="string">"enter again"</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>As you can see, every <strong>if</strong> statements and <strong>for</strong> cycle needs colons. I often forget about these little things.🤬 THEN! ERROR MESSAGE COMING AGAIN!</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.ax1x.com/2020/01/30/1lWEPU.png" alt="1lWEPU.png"></p>
<p>During the class, teacher also taught me another way to solve this question by using <strong>while</strong> cycle:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">spam=<span class="number">0</span></span><br><span class="line">n=int(input(<span class="string">"enter a positive number"</span>))</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">while</span> spam&lt;n:</span><br><span class="line">    print(<span class="string">"*"</span>*spam)</span><br><span class="line">    spam=spam+<span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">while</span> spam&gt;-n+<span class="number">1</span>:</span><br><span class="line">    print(<span class="string">"*"</span>*spam)</span><br><span class="line">    spam=spam<span class="number">-1</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>I like this question because it looks really interesting if I didn’t learn these syntaxes. I also learned many other amazing things which can even be used in our daily life. I will share them with you next time!😊</p>
<p><strong>I believe that these problems will disappear someday if I have written enough codes to practice!</strong></p>

<p>The past is not the future, there is no failure, only temporary cessation of success.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.ax1x.com/2020/01/18/1pO95q.jpg" alt="1pO95q.jpg"></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>2019</em></strong></p>
<p>In 2019, I entered the second year of high school(AS). New teachers came, the previous ones left because of various reasons. To be honest, my favourite English teacher left, we were all upset as he said that he would teach us till the end of second year. Although I didn’t do well in the subject he taught, I really like him. Whether seniors or parents said that courses in AS are hard to study, about this, I want to say “YES!”. Actually, I don’t know why, after attending high school, I felt like I am free, no one would spy on me, as a result, I did bad on my grades. At the second year, I found that I couldn’t go on like this, I needed to improve my score. Till now, which is end of my last semester. I can summarize that I am still on the way to success. Just like the introduction, experiences in the past were temporary cessation of success, no matter results were, I still need to work hard and improve myself. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><em>2020</em></strong></p>
<p>In 2020, I think this year is the most important year in my life. I will attend A-level exams in May and June, which have scores for university reference. Up to now, I only have fewer than 5 months for my preparation, my grades still need to be improved. Application to universities also needs to be prepared well from now on. How busy I will be in 2020. TAT. I hope I can achieve my goal, which is the standard for UCL psychology. The road to a G5 university is not easy. Studying abroad also needs courage. Studying in international department is not as easy as I thought before, I know that my parents have paid a lot of money for me to study and help me achieve my goal, especially my mother, the only one family member supports me to learn psychology in university. When I get low marks in exams, she always feels angry and criticize me, sometimes I feel depressed, I also want to have high scores as she wants. I won’t have excuses afterwards because both my mother and I have the same goal, I will work harder and make her satisfy. I hope that both she and I will be happy when the scores in summer are published!!!</p>
