<p><em>Acute and chronic organic pain</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Acute pain is an intense pain that lasts until healing has begun (the pain of appendicitis or of a broken limb).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Chronic pain are pains that last more than three months, and can be constant or intermittent.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Theories of pain: Chronic pain might have originated with an initial trauma, injury or infection, or there might be an ongoing cause of pain. However, some people suffer chronic pain in the absence of any past injury or evidence of body damage.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Specificity-Theory-Descartes"><a href="#Specificity-Theory-Descartes" class="headerlink" title="Specificity Theory (Descartes)"></a>Specificity Theory (Descartes)</h3><p>Descartes described pain as a perception that exists in the brain and makes the distinction between the neural phenomenon of sensory transduction and the perceptual experience of pain.</p>
<ol>
<li>Gate Control Theory (Melzack, 1965)</li>
</ol>
<p>The Gate Control Theory of pain argues that the nerve impulses which produce pain pass through a series of ‘gates’ on their way to the brain, and that these gates are influenced by messages descending from the brain and by other information that we are receiving. Conditions that open the gate (and therefore enhances pain perception) include extent of injury, inappropriate activity level, anxiety, or boredom. Conditions that close the gate (and therefore inhibits pain perception) include medication, positive emotions, relaxation and intense concentration or distraction. This theory incorporates both physiological contributions and also mental influences. </p>

<ol start="2">
<li>Psychogenic pain (phantom limb pain)</li>
</ol>
<p>Psychogenic pain is physical pain that is caused, increased or prolonged by mental, emotional or behavioural factors. Phantom limb pain refers to ongoing painful sensations that seem to be coming from the part of the limb that is no longer there. Melzack gave an explanation for phantom limbs, arguing that our brain contains a neuromatrix that serves as a mental hologram. When parts of the body is removed, the corresponding neurons still exist, therefore creating the illusion of perceived sensations from that limb. </p>
<p><em>Mirror box can be an effective technique treating phantom limb pains, since it creates a an artificial visual feedback that allows the patient to move and unclench the phantom limb.</em></p>

<li>Money as an incentive (Yokley &amp; Glenwick, 1984)</li>
</ol>
<p>The purpose of the study by Yokley and Glenwick (1984) was to evaluate the relative impact of four conditions for motivating parents to take their children to be immunised. Four strategies were tested separately in a mid-west city, including general prompt, specific prompt (with the child’s name), increased access (extend clinic hours) and monetary incentives (with monetary rewards). We found that the monetary incentive condition has the greatest impact on promoting immunisation, but the specific prompt condition may be the most cost-effective method. </p>

<li>The Funhaler (Watt et al., 2003)</li>
</ol>
<p>In their 2003 study Watt et al. stated that poor adherence to prescribed frequency and technique remains a major problem for paediatric asthmatics on inhaled medication. They aimed to demonstrate that the Funhaler does not interfere with drug delivery and can improve a child’s adherence to using their inhaler. The device incorporates a number of features to distract the attention of children from the drug delivery itself and to provide a means of self-reinforcing through the use of effective breathing techniques. Watt et al. found that the use of Funhaler was associated with improved parental and child compliance.</p>

    <title>Measuring non-adherences</title>
    <url>/2020/08/07/Measuring%20non-adherences/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h2 id="Measuring-non-adherences"><a href="#Measuring-non-adherences" class="headerlink" title="Measuring non-adherences"></a>Measuring non-adherences</h2><ol>
<li>self-reports (Riekart &amp; Droter, 1999)</li>
</ol>
<p>Self-report measures involve asking the patient or the doctor if the patient is following their treatment programme. </p>
<p>Patients’ reports may be distorted by response biases, thus the validity of self-reports remains a challenge. </p>
<p>Riekart and Droter(1999) wanted to examine whether non-participation in self-report studies is associated with low levels of adherence. </p>
<p>The participants in the study were adolescents with diabetes. The respondents and their parents were asked to complete a series of questionnaires and interviews immediately after their appointment at the clinic. Both the adolescent and the parents were given a further questionnaire to be completed at home with a self-addressed return envelope. <em>If the questionnaires were not returned within ten days of the interview, the family was called once to remind them.</em> The results showed significant differences in adherence levels between those who returned their questionnaires and those who did not. The families that returned their questionnaires had adolescents who had higher adherence interview scores and tested their blood sugar more frequently that adolescents in families who did not return their questionnaires.</p>
<hr>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Both self-consent and parental consents were obtained for each participant, this is a good ethics practice. The adolescents as well as their parents were given a chance to withdraw from the study if they feel uncomfortable at any point. </p>
</li>
<li><p>This study has high ecological validity. Participants were recruited from a real-life clinic, and the questionnaires assessed their natural behaviours at home. This can increase the generalisability of the results. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<ul>
<li>This sample is not representative, since all participants were diabetic adolescents. Therefore, the results may not be able to generalise to diabetic patients in other age groups, or patients with other diseases. </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ol start="2">
<li>pill counting (Chung &amp; Naya,2000)</li>
</ol>
<p>During clinical visits, health professionals are trained to count the number of tablets left in a pill bottle and to advise the patient about adherence if the patient missed dosages based on the expected number of pills compared with those remaining.</p>
<p>57 patients with a history of asthma took part in this research. Each patients received 56 tablets with one week’s supply to spare. Tablets were dispensed in screw -top bottles fitted with a TrackCap medication event monitoring system device. Patients are scheduled to return to the clinic every three weeks for four more visits where tablet counts were taken to compare with TrackCap monitoring and one tablet in the evening approximately 12 hours apart. Results indicated that TrackCap has a higher accuracy in measuring non-adherence than traditional pill-counting. Chung and Naya concluded that it is possible to assess adherence with an oral medication using a medication event monitoring system like TrackCap.</p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/08/07/afR4gA.png" alt="afR4gA.png"></p>
<hr>
<ol start="3">
<li>biochemical tests(Roth, 1978)</li>
</ol>
<p>In his 1987 review of measuring adherence, Roth suggests that patient self-reports are usually correct when they say that they are taking little or no medicine, but commonly overestimated when they say that they are taking their medicine regularly. Doctors usually overestimate their patients’ intake of a medical treatment. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>By taking blood or urine samples from patients it is possible to see of the drug has been taken. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The precise concentrations are useful in demonstrating whether there is a clinically effective dosage to treat particular disorder and if the dosage need to be altered. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Empirical evidence has shown that adherence for prescribed medications is higher with frequent urine monitoring. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ol start="4">
<li>repeat prescriptions (Sherman et al.)</li>
</ol>
<p>This study wanted to determine if a prescription refill history at the patients pharmacies can identify poor adherence with asthma medications more frequently than the doctor’s assessment from clinical appointments. The results suggested that checking prescription refills is an accurate and practical method of identifying patients who are not adhering to medical requests and that doctors are not reliably able to tell if a patient is taking their inhaler through consultations alone.</p>

    <title>Adherence to medical advice</title>
    <url>/2020/08/07/adherence-to-medical-advice/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h3 id="Types-of-non-adherence-and-problems-caused-by-non-adherence"><a href="#Types-of-non-adherence-and-problems-caused-by-non-adherence" class="headerlink" title="Types of non-adherence and problems caused by non-adherence"></a>Types of non-adherence and problems caused by non-adherence</h3><p><em>Morbidity: the incidence of a disease across a population and/or geographic location during a predefined timeframe.</em></p>
<p><em>Mortality: the rate of death in a population.</em></p>
<p><em>Definition: Adherence can be defined as the extent to which a patient’s behaviour and following of treatment programmes coincides with the advice and guidance provided by doctors and other health care professionals.</em></p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Why patients don’t adhere: rational non-adherence(Bulpitt,1994)</li>
</ul>
<p>The rational choice theory states that patients may make rational decisions when they choose not to take the prescribed drugs. Bulpitt suggested that patients may overestimate the costs of drugs, and underestimate the benefits drugs bring. This would result in them making a seemingly “rational” choice of non-adherence. However, according to statistics from large-scale studies, Bulpitt suggested that drugs such as those for hypertension still has larger benefits compared to side effects, thus patients should still adhere to medical advices. </p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>The health belief model (Becker,1974)</li>
</ul>
<p>The health belief model aims to predict when a person will engage in preventative health behaviours.</p>
<p>Individuals decide whether or not they should take preventative actions based on evaluating the threat and analysing costs-benefits. When evaluating the threat of a certain diseases, the patients take into account both personal susceptibility and seriousness of the disease. Other influencing variables include demographic, sociopsychological, and structural variables. Sometimes certain events can also serve as cues to action, which increases the likelihood of preventative health behaviours. Finally individuals would compare the perceived benefits of action to perceived barriers, and make a final decision of whether or not preventative actions will be taken.</p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/08/07/afU83D.png" alt="afU83D.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Compliance Model</li>
</ul>
<p>In 1974, Becker developed the Compliance Model. The model could be used to predict factors that would influence the likelihood of a patient adhering to any medical requests. This model was supported by a study conducted in 1971 where a random sample of 125 cases was drawn from a population of children being treated in the Comprehensive Child Care Clinic at a large teaching hospital. The children were placed on a course of liquid oral antibiotic and a follow-up visit. An hour-long interview was conducted with each patient immediately after their doctor’s appointment. The results showed that mothers who adhered to various aspects of the prescribed treatment were more interested in their child’s health in general, and were more concerned about the present illness. They perceived that illness was a substantial threat to their child, but had confidence in the ability of physicians and medication to reduce this threat.</p>
<p>Evaluation:</p>
<p>Strengths: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Both rational choice theory and the health belief model have supporting empirical evidence that provides credibility to their underlying ideas about adherence to medical requests. </p>
</li>
<li><p>This study has application to everyday life, since if we understand the reasons why parents don’t send their children to the hospital, we may take targeted actions to counteract them. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The research relies on self-report measures to gain an insight into the reasons for adherence which increases social desirability.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The sample may not be representative of all the children’s parents in general, since those who ultimately decided not to come would not be selected.</p>
</li>
</ul>

People with this disorder often interpret normal sensations, minor symptoms and bodily functions as a sign of an illness with a negative outcome.</p>
<p>Patients perceived threat from trigger including information, event, illness and image and produced apprehension which would lead to increased focus on body, increased physiological arousal, checking behaviour and reassurance seeking. Preoccupation with perceived alteration of bodily sensations would make them contain misinterpretation of body sensations and signs as indicating severe illness which became perceived threat again.</p>

The study was conducted in the waiting rooms of four clinics in a large inner-city hospital, patients were approached and interviewed to collect data. Questions included their health behaviours leading up to their current illness and their reaction to their symptoms. This experiment concluded that a variety of factors, perceptual, situational and appraisal strategies, affect delay in seeking medical treatment.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><p>Appraisal delay: Frequency, severity and location of symptoms, Perceived importance of symptoms, Lack of awareness of the nature of the symptoms, Trying a ‘home remedy’, Lack of monitoring, Family pressure.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Illness delay: Awareness that you cannot treat the illness yourself, Perception of the consequences of the illness as severe, Beliefs about the benefits of any treatment, Fear about illness.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Utilisation delay: Obstacles to receiving care (money/time), Lack of familiarity with medical services, Demographic factors (age, sex, education, marital status and ethnicity).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Strength</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>With the use of a variety self-report measures, researchers can gain in-depth understanding into the reasons why patients decide to delay in seeking treatments. This understanding can increase the validity of the results.</li>
<li>The sample size was relatively large and containing both males and females, so its population validity and representativeness is high, resulting in a highly generalisable conclusion.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Weakness</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This study used self-reports to collect data, this could be susceptible to social desirability bias. Patients may prefer to answer in a socially desirable way, reducing the validity of the results. </li>
<li>Since all participants were recruited from the hospital waiting room, those who ultimately decided not to seek treatment were not included in our sample. Thus the result’s generalisability is limited. </li>

These words were subsequently tested in a group of patients from a maternity hospital. The patients described their understanding of these terms and their answers were subsequently rated by another group of doctors one year later. Results indicated that doctors generally underestimated patients’ abilities in understanding medical terms, and those who use maternity service more often demonstrated a higher level of understanding compared to others. </p>
<hr>
<p>Strength:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This study has high interrater reliability, doctors gave similar ratings to patients’ understanding of medical terms. </p>
</li>
<li><p>This study has good ethical practices, when the patients were tested about their understanding of the medical terms, they were instructed that if they fail to answer any of the questions it’s not their fault. They were also told that the test is merely for indicating which words doctors should avoid in communication with patients. This can reduce potential psychological distresses patients may experience during the study. [Protection from harm]</p>

<hr>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<ul>
<li>Participants in this study were only recruited from maternity hospital in England. They may not be representative of the general patients population.</li>

<p>This experiment was carried out by McKinstry and Wang in 1991.</p>
<p>The study investigated doctor’s clothing as a form of non-verbal communication. More than 400 participants were recruited and interviewed using eight photographs. The phogoraphs depicted male or female doctors dressed in different clothing. They were asked to rate the doctors on perceived competency.<br>Results showed that most patients preferred doctors dressed in formal clothing. Also past experiences<br>may have an influence over their perception as well, since patients from different medical centers showed systematic preferences towards formally or informally dressed doctors. The researchers concluded that clothing can have an impact over patients’ perception of the doctor. </p>
<hr>
<p>Strength</p>
<ul>
<li>this study has a large sample size. This can increase the representativeness of the sample, thus making<br>results more generalisable to the entire patients population.</li>
<li>the testing stimuli included photographs of both male and female doctors, this reduces potential bias<br>and makes results more generalisable to the entire doctors population.</li>
</ul>
<p>Weakness</p>
<ul>
<li>Patients were selected from Scotland only, they may have unique cultural bias. Thus the results may<br>not be generalisable to patients from other cultures. </li>
<li>Testing stimuli were photos of doctors rather than real person, this task lacks mundane realism, thus<br>reducing the ecological validity of results.</li>

    <title>The Biggest Failure I Experienced</title>
    <url>/2020/04/12/The-Biggest-Failure-I-Experienced/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="The-Biggest-Failure-I-Experienced"><a href="#The-Biggest-Failure-I-Experienced" class="headerlink" title="The Biggest Failure I Experienced"></a>The Biggest Failure I Experienced</h1><p>People always say that “Success is the mother of failure”, while I am a person who is afraid of experiencing failure. In this article, I will talk about the biggest failure I experienced.</p>
<p>Actually, it happened not long ago. It was in first year of my high school. Teachers in JLHS international department often said that IGCSE is a simple exam, designed to help us get used to studying in an international mode. The so-called international-mode of study is to be able to use our own initiative to learn and make plans to study every day. It is different from the studying mode in middle school, I felt quite relaxed in the international department as the teachers did not check our homework very strictly. I am not a very conscientious person, so I did not devote myself to the study of IG. As a result, I did not get satisfactory grades in IGCSE exams. Compared with other students’ grades, all I could feel was powerlessness and regret. I can still remember those feelings very clearly. To be honest, I don’t want to experience them again. This is my biggest failure because this failure will affect my entire high school career and might even affect the rest of my life.</p>
<p>While I think the reason why I felt so disappointed was high expectations from teachers and parents. This is what we called “stress”, stress is a type of psychological pain. Stress can be external and related to the environment, but may also be caused by internal perceptions that cause an individual to experience anxiety or other negative emotions surrounding a situation, such as pressure, discomfort, etc, which they then deem stressful. In China, grade is the most important thing for students to apply for universities. For example, for students in rural areas, studying is the only way for them to be out of poverty and get more opportunities. For them, study is the only way to maintain their social status and class. I think this is why those students work harder than others. Compared with foreign countries, universities focus more on scores students got instead of how many extracurricular activities they attended. The other important reason is peer pressure. Comparing mentality is common among students. For me, I do feel angry and surprised at those who don’t seem to be working hard but are doing very well in studying. As a result, I will feel that all my effort is useless. Two reasons above are external causes. For internal perception, students who have high expectations of themselves take their failures very seriously and may even become depressed, especially those who have had great success. While I think a large psychological gap can be difficult to accept to everyone.</p>
<p>“Learning is your own business”; this is a lesson I have had to learn myself, after starting high school. After that experience, I am motivated to achieve good IG results all the time. Unlike the exams I took in middle school, I know that IG scores are extremely important for international students who will use these scores to apply for their desired universities, so I decided to work harder in AS level. It is unclear whether I did better that year, but I think that my failure in IGCSE really taught me a lot. In my second year of high school, I tried to spend less time on my hobby of Japanese animation. Fortunately, in my opinion, the most striking change is my attitude to studying. In the past, I always gave up easily when I met with a difficult question. I always thought that I would learn it someday instead of figuring it out as soon as possible. Now, when I do my revision, I try to understand every question, I think this has also changed to my personality as I am not as lazy as I used to be.</p>
<p>I have learnt a lot from this experience of failure. Just as the saying goes” Failure can teach us a lot”. In my opinion, I believe that these changes will benefit me all the time. Learning how to study and what a correct attitude is can help me improve my efficiency and manage myself better when I am working independently.</p>

    <title>Gestalt Psychology</title>
    <url>/2020/03/29/Gestalt-Psychology/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="Gestalt-Psychology"><a href="#Gestalt-Psychology" class="headerlink" title="Gestalt Psychology"></a>Gestalt Psychology</h1><p>Gestalt psychology seems so far away from my daily life, actually it is closely related to us, especially when people need to wear masks.</p>
<hr>
<p>When you look at a person wearing a mask, all you can usually see is his eyes. You will be surprised to find that people on the street look more good-looking. The same is true for celebrities, who often wear masks in public places to avoid being noticed by their fans, while most people think that they look more handsome or beautiful with masks. Wearing a mask to look more beautiful women, in Japan are known as beauty mask. With makeup, you can only see eyes when other people wear masks, and your brain will automatically match it to the beautiful face shape you want. Here is an example from a variety show in Japan:</p>
<p><strong>BEFORE REMOVING MASKS</strong></p>

<p><strong>AFTER REMOVING MASKS</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>from Japanese variety show “Summers’ magic questions”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, this is because an interesting psychological knowledge called “<strong>Gestalt-Psychology</strong>“</p>
<p><strong>Gestalt Psychology</strong> is a school of thought that looks at the human mind and behaviour as a whole. When trying to make sense of the world around us, Gestalt psychology suggests that we do not simply focus on every small component. Originating in the work of Max Wertheimer, while Wundt was interested in breaking down psychological matters into their smallest possible part, the Gestalt psychologists were instead interested in looking at the totality of the mind and behaviour.   The guiding principle behind the Gestalt movement was that the whole was greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>The development of Gestalt psychology was influenced in part by Wertheimer’s observations one day at a train station. He purchased a toy stroboscope which displayed pictures in a rapid sequence to mimic the appearing movement. He later proposed the concept of the Phi phenomenon in which flashing lights in sequence can lead to what is known as apparent motion. In other words, we perceive movement where there is none. Movies are one example of apparent motion. Through a sequence of still frames, the illusion of movement is created.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This can be widely used in architecture, design and other fields. For example:</p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/03/29/GZTlZT.jpg" alt="GZTlZT.jpg"></p>
<p>In this picture, you can even imagine what these whole pictures look like, this is exactly an example of gestalt psychology.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes these incomplete logos look more fashionable and attractive.</p>
<hr>
<p>In my opinion, the difference between Psychology and other subjects is that Psychology exists in every little thing in life and Psychology can be found everywhere. However, some common sense of Psychology is easy to understand and interesting, which is why I want to know more about psychology. Maybe when I actually touch it, it may be a little different from what I imagined, but I still want to keep learning more.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<h3 id="Different-kinds-of-people’s-attitudes-to-serious-coronavirus"><a href="#Different-kinds-of-people’s-attitudes-to-serious-coronavirus" class="headerlink" title="Different kinds of people’s attitudes to serious coronavirus"></a>Different kinds of people’s attitudes to serious coronavirus</h3><hr>
<p>As we all know that coronavirus has been threatening us since 2020, it started in China, and now it’s affecting the rest of the world. Nowadays, people see the outbreak in a different light. I think that not only physical but also psychological problems need to be concerned. This article is talking about attitudes and psychological responses of different kinds of people.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Government</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Actually it’s hard to say something about Politics, as I am a Chinese so that I know more about my country. The outbreak originated in Wuhan, obviously the situation in Wuhan is the most serious. Wuhan had been cut off from all external traffic since January 23, and 11 million residents had been forced into quarantine. Other Chinese provinces and cities have since imposed blockades to control the spread of coronavirus. Doctors and nurses from other provinces were also volunteering to fight the epidemic. These actions effectively reduce irrational and unnecessary fears of people because the government has established an image of being responsible for the people. Now, in March, coronavirus has been controlled and most schools and universities post their opening dates.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Medical staff</strong></p>
<p>Since we know that  many doctors and nurses volunteered to help improve situation in Wuhan. However, sometimes we may see that news which was talking about mental breakdown of nurses and doctors. When other people were coming together and enjoyed a big dinner, they were still sticking to their posts and could only silently eat box lunch and takeout. Under this condition, strong comparisons and loneliness can make them feel overwhelmed and unable to stick it out. The more desperate thing was women nurses had to cut off their long hair as not to interfere with their hard work. This significantly increases the risk of depression among medical staff.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Depression is a common mental disorder affecting more than 264 million people worldwide. It is characterized by persistent sadness and a lack of interest or pleasure in previously rewarding or enjoyable activities. It can also disturb sleep and appetite; tiredness and poor concentration are common. The causes of depression include <strong>complex interactions between social, psychological and biological</strong> factors. (<strong>FROM <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/depression#tab=tab_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.who.int/health-topics/depression#tab=tab_1</a></strong>)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Students</strong></p>
<p>I wrote this blog on March 22nd and recently the most common news is international students want to come back to China as soon as possible even though the tickets are expensive and vetted very carefully. From the Internet, I learned about the response of different countries to the coronavirus, and I can fully understand the anxiety of international students and their parents. There are also many examples around me that Parents in China spend a lot of money on a plane ticket for their children to fly back. Some international students even feel like crying when they returned to China and met their parents. Their anxiety and uneasiness of being alone in a foreign land is beyond our imagination. Psychologists predict that there will be a large number of people with PTSD in 2020. For young students aged between 18 and 25, this is probably the first big event in their life, and also the biggest one, the impact is significant. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>PTSD: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a <strong>mental health condition</strong> that’s triggered by a terrifying event — either experiencing it or witnessing it. Symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares and severe anxiety, as well as uncontrollable thoughts about the event. (<strong>FROM<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20355967" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20355967</a></strong>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, I hope that the coronavirus will be controlled effectively in every corner of the world and the world will be restored to its original state!! Both physical and psychological harm can be cured someday!!!❤</p>

    <title>Numpy</title>
    <url>/2020/03/15/Numpy/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="Numpy-Study"><a href="#Numpy-Study" class="headerlink" title="Numpy Study"></a>Numpy Study</h1><p>After learning python, I started to learn numpy, a programming language for processing data. In the beginning, I thought that it seemed like all the programming languages look quite similar so that numpy wouldn’t be so difficult. However, <strong>that is impossible</strong>.😭</p>
<p>While I think I still found some interesting programming codes which are exactly what I imagined how a data-processing system looks like. In my opinion, data can be shown clearly by using line charts, bar charts, tables and normal distribution. Graphs can point out salient features and trends of data. Calculations can have the same functions, I learnt how to find mean, mode and median which are important information for  central tendency of a set of data; variance and standard deviation which are used to indicate spread of a set of data in the school, so I can also calculate these values by writing programming codes. Here is some examples:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">x=np.linspace(<span class="number">0</span>,<span class="number">5</span>,<span class="number">50</span>)</span><br><span class="line">y=np.linspace(<span class="number">0</span>,<span class="number">5</span>,<span class="number">50</span>)[:,np.newaxis]</span><br><span class="line">z=np.sin(x)**<span class="number">10</span>+np.cos(<span class="number">10</span>+y*x)*np.cos(x)</span><br><span class="line">%matplotlib inline</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> matplotlib.pyplot <span class="keyword">as</span> plt</span><br><span class="line">plt.imshow(z,origin=<span class="string">"lower"</span>,extent=[<span class="number">0</span>,<span class="number">5</span>,<span class="number">0</span>,<span class="number">5</span>],cmap=<span class="string">"viridis"</span>)</span><br><span class="line">plt.colorbar();</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>These codes can visualize the quadratic function, the graph looks like below:</p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/03/16/8tirUf.png" alt="8tirUf.png"></p>
<p>To be honest, it’s hard for me to imagine that I can plot those points on the graph and form the graph above, it’s quite amazing.</p>
<p>In addition to the function graph, I can also record data in terms of A scatter diagram and tables.</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> numpy <span class="keyword">as</span> np</span><br><span class="line">rand=np.random.RandomState(<span class="number">42</span>)</span><br><span class="line">mean=[<span class="number">0</span>,<span class="number">0</span>]</span><br><span class="line">cov=[[<span class="number">1</span>,<span class="number">2</span>],[<span class="number">2</span>,<span class="number">5</span>]]</span><br><span class="line">x=rand.multivariate_normal(mean,cov,<span class="number">100</span>)</span><br><span class="line">%matplotlib inline</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> matplotlib.pyplot <span class="keyword">as</span> plt</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> seaborn;seaborn.set()</span><br><span class="line">plt.scatter(x[:,<span class="number">0</span>],x[:,<span class="number">1</span>]);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/03/16/8tFvlQ.png" alt="8tFvlQ.png"></p>
<p>This graph visualises an array of points with a two-dimensional normal distribution.</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">data=[&#123;<span class="string">"a"</span>:i,<span class="string">"b"</span>:<span class="number">2</span> * i&#125;<span class="keyword">for</span> i <span class="keyword">in</span> range(<span class="number">3</span>)]</span><br><span class="line">pd.DataFrame(data)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>This programming code creates a two-dimensional array and records three sets of values in a table.</p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/03/16/8tmFt1.png" alt="8tmFt1.png"></p>
<p>It’s easier for us to use graphs to record these data as there are too much data needed to be processed, compared with thousands of words, graphs are more convenient and clearer. I think this is why humans need to use computers to help them work and this is why I need to learn them, some programmes can help me study with higher efficiency and more saved time. This is also reasons for not only science subjects but also liberal arts require students to know about programming codes and high-level statistical ability.</p>
<p>To be honest, I didn’t do well in numpy, it’s still hard for me to write a program without any help from coursebooks, maybe I need more chances to exercise and use it as a tool in my studying. I hope I can use it freely if I can have a chance to do my own experiment someday!😊</p>

    <title>Exams are coming..</title>
    <url>/2020/03/07/Exams-are-coming/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="Exams-are-coming"><a href="#Exams-are-coming" class="headerlink" title="Exams are coming.."></a>Exams are coming..</h1><p>Time goes really fast. There is only <strong>58</strong> days left till I will go to take exams. As we all know, AS exams are the most important exams in three years. However, when I realised that there is not much time left, there is only few days for me to review. This blog is used to record my revision plan.</p>
<hr>
<p>For <strong>Maths</strong> and <strong>Psychology</strong>, which I will take A-level exams, I will pay most of my attention on these two subjects because I want to use them to apply for universities. Although I am still learning A-level psychology, I don’t know whether I can have enough time to review, I will try to. For Maths, I don’t know other easier ways to review science subjects, maybe doing exercises is the most efficient way. I will do as many exercises as I can.</p>
<p>For three subjects left, I will try to achieve as high marks as possible, although I don’t like some subjects among them.. I don’t know whether I will continue learning them in A2, but I will try my best. I decided to do two paper for each subject from next week. Chemistry, Physics and Computer science, they are all science, I have said that the only way is doing exercises(why I only learn one liberal art /(ㄒoㄒ)/~~) </p>
<hr>
<p>Sometimes I cannot bear such studying mode and want to play games, watch animation. I didn’t do well in IG exams, without any course, I didn’t focus on studying that time. I don’t want to regret again. This time, I want to work hard and achieve my goal! Actually, I have decided what to do in summer holiday, I hope I can have a whole happy summer holiday (including score posted day). </p>

    <title>MY MAGIC PYTHON STUDYING</title>
    <url>/2020/01/30/MY%20MAGIC%20PYTHON%20STUDYING/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="HELLO-PYTHON"><a href="#HELLO-PYTHON" class="headerlink" title="HELLO! PYTHON!!!"></a>HELLO! PYTHON!!!</h1><p><img src="https://s2.ax1x.com/2020/01/30/1lr3eU.jpg" alt="1lr3eU.jpg"></p>
<p>This is my first time learning python, I heard about this programming code for a long time because as a student who chose Computer Science, I learned vb.net which is less used by people nowadays in the school. Other boys often talk about python, they said python is easier and useful. This winter holiday, finally! It’s my time to learn python!</p>
<hr>
<p>Maybe because I learned vb.net before, I found that programming code of python is similar to that of vb.net, including value assignment and other functions, so it’s easier for me to start. Of course, differences exist, I realised that python is much closer to human language than other programming codes. It is more convenient because we don’t need to declare each variables before using them into our code. Python is a language which is very sensible to indenting and strict to code formatting, I always fail to indent correctly and my code cannot be run successfully. <strong>FOR EXAMPLE</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://s2.ax1x.com/2020/01/30/1l2Ml9.png" alt="1l2Ml9.png"></p>
<p>Since I learned python, I cannot count how many times I saw this error message after clicking RUN button🙂 Sometimes I felt corrupted and entered a dead cycle. (<del>It’s a real hair loss</del>) Another common mistake is <strong>“:”</strong> Here is an example:</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.ax1x.com/2020/01/30/1lRS76.png" alt="1lRS76.png"></p>
<p>This is my python homework after first class, I felt quite familiar with this shape because I did solve this question in the school. However, it took me much time writing python programming code <strong>because of “:”</strong> My code is shown below:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">n=int(input(<span class="string">"enter a positive number"</span>))</span><br><span class="line">i=<span class="number">0</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> n&gt;=<span class="number">3</span>:</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">for</span> i <span class="keyword">in</span> range(n):</span><br><span class="line">        print(<span class="string">"*"</span> * i)</span><br><span class="line">        i=i+<span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">for</span> i <span class="keyword">in</span> range(n,<span class="number">0</span>,<span class="number">-1</span>):  </span><br><span class="line">        print(<span class="string">"*"</span> * i)</span><br><span class="line">        i=i+<span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">else</span>:</span><br><span class="line">    print(<span class="string">"enter again"</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>As you can see, every <strong>if</strong> statements and <strong>for</strong> cycle needs colons. I often forget about these little things.🤬 THEN! ERROR MESSAGE COMING AGAIN!</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.ax1x.com/2020/01/30/1lWEPU.png" alt="1lWEPU.png"></p>
<p>During the class, teacher also taught me another way to solve this question by using <strong>while</strong> cycle:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">spam=<span class="number">0</span></span><br><span class="line">n=int(input(<span class="string">"enter a positive number"</span>))</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">while</span> spam&lt;n:</span><br><span class="line">    print(<span class="string">"*"</span>*spam)</span><br><span class="line">    spam=spam+<span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">while</span> spam&gt;-n+<span class="number">1</span>:</span><br><span class="line">    print(<span class="string">"*"</span>*spam)</span><br><span class="line">    spam=spam<span class="number">-1</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>I like this question because it looks really interesting if I didn’t learn these syntaxes. I also learned many other amazing things which can even be used in our daily life. I will share them with you next time!😊</p>
<p><strong>I believe that these problems will disappear someday if I have written enough codes to practice!</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>2019</em></strong></p>
<p>In 2019, I entered the second year of high school(AS). New teachers came, the previous ones left because of various reasons. To be honest, my favourite English teacher left, we were all upset as he said that he would teach us till the end of second year. Although I didn’t do well in the subject he taught, I really like him. Whether seniors or parents said that courses in AS are hard to study, about this, I want to say “YES!”. Actually, I don’t know why, after attending high school, I felt like I am free, no one would spy on me, as a result, I did bad on my grades. At the second year, I found that I couldn’t go on like this, I needed to improve my score. Till now, which is end of my last semester. I can summarize that I am still on the way to success. Just like the introduction, experiences in the past were temporary cessation of success, no matter results were, I still need to work hard and improve myself. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><em>2020</em></strong></p>
<p>In 2020, I think this year is the most important year in my life. I will attend A-level exams in May and June, which have scores for university reference. Up to now, I only have fewer than 5 months for my preparation, my grades still need to be improved. Application to universities also needs to be prepared well from now on. How busy I will be in 2020. TAT. I hope I can achieve my goal, which is the standard for UCL psychology. The road to a G5 university is not easy. Studying abroad also needs courage. Studying in international department is not as easy as I thought before, I know that my parents have paid a lot of money for me to study and help me achieve my goal, especially my mother, the only one family member supports me to learn psychology in university. When I get low marks in exams, she always feels angry and criticize me, sometimes I feel depressed, I also want to have high scores as she wants. I won’t have excuses afterwards because both my mother and I have the same goal, I will work harder and make her satisfy. I hope that both she and I will be happy when the scores in summer are published!!!</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="4-Markdown语法介绍"><a href="#4-Markdown语法介绍" class="headerlink" title="4.Markdown语法介绍"></a>4.Markdown语法介绍</h1><p>在前面的课程中，我们已经成功搭建了我们的blog，并将它放到了github通过域名进行访问，今天我们来学习一下如何用Markdown来写文章。</p>
<p>首先简要介绍一下什么是Markdown：</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Markdown 是一种轻量级标记语言，它允许人们使用易读易写的纯文本格式编写文档。</p>
</li>
<li><p>Markdown 语言在 2004 由约翰·格鲁伯（英语：John Gruber）创建。</p>
</li>
<li><p>Markdown 编写的文档可以导出 HTML 、Word、图像、PDF、Epub 等多种格式的文档。</p>
</li>
<li><p>Markdown 编写的文档后缀为 <code>.md</code>,  <code>.markdown</code>。</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-Markdown标题"><a href="#1-Markdown标题" class="headerlink" title="1.Markdown标题"></a>1.Markdown标题</h3><p>我们使用<code>#</code>号来标记我们的标题,一共有六级标题,分别对应1到6个<code>#</code>号,如下</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"># 一级标题</span><br><span class="line">## 二级标题</span><br><span class="line">### 三级标题</span><br><span class="line">#### 四级标题</span><br><span class="line">##### 五级标题</span><br><span class="line">###### 六级标题</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
